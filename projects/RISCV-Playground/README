;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This projects contains an example for a simple RISC-V RV32IMC microcontroller
based on the FemtoRV32-Gracilis written by Bruno Levy and Matthias Koch:

https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/
https://github.com/BrunoLevy/learn-fpga/blob/master/FemtoRV/RTL/PROCESSOR/femtorv32_gracilis.v

Peripherals included for default:

  - Textmode LCD driver with 7-Bit ASCII font
  - Random number generator
  - GPIO registers for PMOD pin access
  - Timer tick interrupt
  - LEDs
  - UART terminal, 115200 Baud 8N1 LF
  - 1 kb initialised RAM for bootloader
  - 128 kb RAM initialised using file read interface over SPI

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;  Memory map and IO
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Memory areas are selected using bits [31:28].

0x00000000 - 0x0001FFFF: 128 kb SPRAM blocks, initialised by bootloader
0x10000000 - 0x100005FF: 1536 bytes character buffer, 40x30=1200 chars on LCD, byte access only
0x20000000 - 0x200003FF: 1024 bytes font data, 128 characters, 8 bytes per character, byte access only
0x40000000 - 0x4FFFFFFF: Peripheral IO registers
0x80000000 - 0x800003FF: 1 kb initialised BRAM, containing bootloader
0x90000000 - 0x9FFFFFFF: File read interface over SPI, mapped into memory, read only

The bootloader initialises the large 128 kb RAM block for you reading from file
0xdabbad00 and also prepares the LCD for textmode display.

For using the display, all you have is to write characters into the 1200 bytes starting
at 0x10000000. The font (starting at 0x20000000) contains 128 glyphs, taken from the
Commodore 64 and rearranged for 7 bit ASCII. The MSB (0x80) selects a "highlight" pair of
foreground/background colors.

Both character and font data areas can be read and written using byte access only.

The IO registers with base 0x40000000 have a few specialities in their address decoding.

All of these are word-addressable with bits [1:0] zero, but also half-word or byte addressable
using the bits [1] or [1:0], respectively. This is useful, for example, to change background or
foreground colors separately, or accessing PMOD registers either all at once or separate.

Bits [3:2] are reserved for atomic Clear, Set, Toggle operation when writing.

Address +  0: Normal write, use the value from the processor as-is
Address +  4: Clear  bits in register that are 1 in the write access
Address +  8: Set    bits in register that are 1 in the write access
Address + 12: Toggle bits in register that are 1 in the write access

It works on all writeable registers, and in word, halfword and byte writes.
Bits [3:2] are ignored on reads.

0x40000010: RW  PMOD [23:16] DIR [15:8] OUT [7:0] IN
0x40000010: RO  PMOD, byte access: IN
0x40000011: RW  PMOD, byte access: OUT
0x40000012: RW  PMOD, byte access: DIR

0x40000020: RW  Example register
0x40000040: RO  Example feedback register
0x40000080: RO  Button states

0x40000100: RW  LEDs: [6] Blue in [5] Green in [4] Red in   [3] 0 [2] Blue [1] Green [0] Red
0x40000200: RW  Sigma-delta modulator brightness for red   channel
0x40000400: RW  Sigma-delta modulator brightness for green channel
0x40000800: RW  Sigma-delta modulator brightness for blue  channel

0x40001000: RW  LCD control and sync lines
0x40002000: WO  LCD data and command
0x40004000: RW  Normal    color [31:16] background [15:0] foreground
0x40008000: RW  Highlight color [31:16] background [15:0] foreground

0x40010000: RW  Serial terminal. Write: Send character [7:0]. Read: Received character [7:0] and flags.
0x40020000: RO  For reading flags [10] Random [9] Busy [8] Valid without removing character [7:0] from receive FIFO.

0x40040000: RW  Timer count register. Generates interrupt on overflow.
0x40080000: RW  Timer reload value after overflow, default 0.

0x40100000 to
0x48000000 are unused and can serve for your own enhancements.

Bits [27:4] are one-hot decoded. Every register has its own bit, which simplifies
the decoding logic, and also allows to set multiple registers at once.

For example, writing to 0x4000C0000 will set both the timer count and timer reload
register at once to the same value. When reading with multiple bits in [27:4] set,
the individual register contents are ORed together.

The serial terminal flags contain a ring oscillator used for random numbers,
but wait (a few) 100 clock cycles before capturing the next random bit because
one gets correlations between the bits when reading too fast.
Just give the ring oscillator a little bit of time to drift away.

Button state bits are:

    0 - joystick down
    1 - joystick up
    2 - joystick left
    3 - joystick right
    4 - joystick press
    5 - home
    6 - menu
    7 - select
    8 - start
    9 - accept
   10 - back

;  Example firmware
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bootloader:

  This one is included into the bitstream for default.
  It initialises the LCD display and initialises the 128 kb RAM from
  file "0xdabbad00" using the file read interface over SPI provided
  by the ESP32 firmware.

Tinyblinky:

  A little blinky in RISC-V assembler. A nice "hello world" project.

Interrupt:

  An example on how to use interrupts on RISC-V, including notes
  on compressed opcodes and and small tools for printing hex numbers.

Mandelbrot:

  Explore the Mandelbrot and Tricorn fractals in ASCII art.
  This example shows how to use the LCD and buttons in assembler.

Graphics:

  An example for drawing graphics - for real, no ASCII art this time.
  Initialises the LCD for graphics, calculates a 256 entries color palette
  (hat off to Rrrola for his "Symetrie" palette) and draws Mandelbrot set.

Hello GCC:

  A small project in C featuring serial terminal, buttons, LED and LCD.

Forth:

  This is a port of Mecrisp-Quintus, a 32 Bit Forth implementation,
  available under GPL3.

  For more info, get the full release of Mecrisp-Quintus here:

  http://mecrisp.sourceforge.net/

  Useful for debugging, and maybe for you, too. If you have not used
  Forth before, better start with this implementation of Forth that
  comes with much more badge support code:

The GNU binutils for RISC-V include the assembler.

Unlike as for the FPGA tools that change rapidly,
you can just have a look for binary packages in your distribution.

For Debian 11 Stable "Bullseye", one gets using

  apt-cache search binutils | grep riscv

binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu - GNU binary utilities, for riscv64-linux-gnu target
binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu-dbg - GNU binary utilities, for riscv64-linux-gnu target (debug symbols)
binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf - GNU assembler, linker and binary utilities for RISC-V processors

Both binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu and binutils-riscv64-unknown-elf are fine,
but you might have to adjust the actual invocations to the tools depending
on which package(s) you actually installed.

Despite the names, these also support 32 bit RISC-V targets.
